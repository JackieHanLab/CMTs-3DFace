Code for "Privacy-Preserving Age Estimation from Human 3D Facial Data with Coordinate-Wise Monotonic Transformations"

# Facial point cloud-based age estimation
Use scripts in **FPCT-age**. Put your data split record (e.g. in txt format) in **DataSplit**. Modify **config.yaml** in **config** for your model and training specifications. Run **script_main.py** with hydra-style value passing (>https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/).

The folder "FPCT-ID" contains necessary code for training and evaluation of facial point cloud-based face verification model. 

The folder "Preprocessing" contains 

"FPCT-ID" and "preprocessing"
